**Description**</br>
  FreeCodeCamp has five JS coding projects required for obtaining "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification.
  [*Js-projects-fcc*](link) contains five folders. 
  Each folder has two files in it:
  1. A text file that contains description of code
  2. A JS file that contains code itself
  
  NOTE: There is no dependancies between JS files in this repository.
  
  One way to see the code in action is to:
  1. Download a JS file you'd like to test
  2. Instal Node.js to your computer
  3. Install Node.js plugin to a text editor of your liking
  4. Run downloaded JS file in your text editor
  5. Check the output in the code editor's termninal
  
  Before you start playing with the code please make sure to get acquainted with the associated readme file. It will help you understand the problem a program solves and what input it expects.
  NOTE: Making the program handle arbitraty input appropriately was out of scope of FreeCodeCamp challenges, so by passing arguments of unexpected type you will get "undefined" in the console output... at best :smiling_imp:. For smooth testing experience, once again, please refer to a readme file associated with the program in question.
  To test the program you can scroll down the JS file (once its opened in a text editor) and change arguments you are calling the function with.
  Good luck!
